	<h1> Time Space and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity evaluates how an algorithm's execution time grows with input size, allowing programmers to select the most efficient approaches.</p>
         <p><b>Space Complexity</b> describes the memory resources an algorithm requires as a function of input, commonly noted as O(n)</p>
